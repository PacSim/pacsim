# How to use

## Docker Compose

The simulator is inside a docker container, which by running it, the simulator will also be launched. To do this, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Code Development - Dev Container

In case you want to do some work inside the container, by using the Dev Containers extension in VSCode the process becomes very simple, since there is a .devcontainer which contains the configuration for a development container for that purpose.
